## Rough Script

1. Intro
2. Desired outcomes of mini lecture: 
- Understand workflows as both a concept and language 
- Articulate the importance of workflows in bioinformatics, and explain how they affect metadata
- Spark an interest in workflows, automation, and standardization beyond (meta)data standards

3. What is a workflow? _(Pause and allow time to consider this.)_
4. Then, start suggesting where workflows might already be occuring in daily life.
5. And then, move into an example. Take, for example: making coffee.
7. Our coffee-making workflow has multiple inputs and outputs. We could say it starts with the input of a currency, which produces the output of a bag of whole coffee beans. Which then itself becomes an input, with the output of ground coffee. Ground coffee then becomes our input into the coffee machine, which finally proudces the output of liquid gold, I mean, coffee. This idea of inputs and outputs, with outputs that then become inputs, can help us understand workflows. 
8. So again, what are workflows? While workflows can be as simple as describing how you flow through multiple work tasks, they can also be rather computationally complex, involving multiple programming languages, databases, inputs, outputs, and a lot of intervening steps. And that's where workflows come in when we're talking about data. You can also think of these as pipelines, though that tends to be associated with analysis. Whereas in bioinformatics, we need to do a good bit of processing, during a lengthy workflow, before we can begin to think about analysis.
9. So how about a definition? As you might imagine, it's a bit of a vague concept, so it's not easy to define, but I came across this one and liked how simple it was. So here we have it: a workflow is, "a sequence of operations to complete a process."
10. It's a simple definition, but we're going to walk through a pretty complex real-world example, using my current area of work -- bioinformatics and biomedical data curation. 
11. So you might be asking yourself: why workflows? Well, that's why we're going to use an example from the world of bioinformatics, because the answer has to do with a biological experimentation technique called next-generation, or 'next-gen,' sequencing -- or NGS, for short. There's also some other reasons we might care about workflows from a data curation perspective, and I'll get to those, after we talk about NGS.
12. So what's NGS?? I'll unpack this more in the next slide, and I've also linked a bunch of resources in the end notes, but you may already be familiar with it, due to the COVID-19 crisis. Lately, you might've heard NGS, or just 'sequencing,' come up in talk of COVID-19 variants. Variants refer to genomic variants of the virus, and we've discovered all the current ones through NGS, through a public health technique called genomic surveillance. Basically, scientists sequence the genome of the virus, looking for mutations, or variations (variants). These variants can prove difficult, but we're able to find out about them faster, as quickly as overnight, through NGS. COVID sucks, but NGS is pretty exciting.
13. Anyway, so what do
